# documentcloud-pages

This is a work-in-progress.

# Goals

A responsive, embeddable javascript library which displays pages from documents on DocumentCloud (or any other API compatible location).

# Why?

1. DocumentCloud's existing document-viewer is not well suited for mobile devices due to it's pioneering nature (it was originally written in 2006 and is holding up remarkably well despite that fact).
2. There are a number of usecases where it's useful just to display a single page from a document to support one's articles/arguments, and DocumentCloud's note capabilities would compliment this use of single pages of supporting material well.
3. DocumentCloud plans on incrementally building a responsive viewer from smaller constituent components, and a full page with notes is the next step up from our smaller individual note embeds.
