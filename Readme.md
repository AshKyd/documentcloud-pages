# documentcloud-pages

This is a work in progress. Follow the development at this repo's [Github pages](http://documentcloud.github.io/documentcloud-pages/).

# Goals

A responsive, embeddable javascript library which displays pages from documents on DocumentCloud (or any other API compatible location).

# Why?

1. DocumentCloud's existing [document-viewer](https://github.com/documentcloud/document-viewer) doesn't play terribly well with mobile devices due to its pioneering nature (it was originally written in 2006 and has done a terrific job in the intervening time).
2. There are a number of use cases where it's useful just to display a single page from a document to support one's articles/arguments, and [DocumentCloud's note capabilities](http://www.documentcloud.org/help/notes) would complement this use of single pages of supporting material well.
3. DocumentCloud plans to incrementally build a responsive viewer from smaller constituent components, and a full page with notes is the next step up from [our smaller individual note embeds](http://www.documentcloud.org/help/notes).
